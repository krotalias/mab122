#
#  A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set 
#  of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of 
#  these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph. 
#  These pairs are known as edges, arcs, or lines for an undirected graph and as arrows, 
#  directed edges, directed arcs, or directed lines for a directed graph. 
#  The vertices may be part of the graph structure, or may be external entities represented 
#  by integer indices or references.
